# Energy-and-Performance-Aware-Task-Scheduling-in-MCC
This repository reproduces the results of the paper "Energy and Performance-Aware Task Scheduling in a Mobile Cloud Computing Environment".
The algorithms and experiments were implemented in C++ to replicate the scheduling process and output the results. The output data was further visualized using Python, providing insightful visual representations of the findings.
